## Orbital Transfer Calculator

A calculation tool for orbital transfer trajectories in the physics simulator ***Kerbal Space Program***.
Enter information about your current orbit and desination, and the program will calculate the necessary
transfer trajectories using real life astronomical formulas.

### Glossary

***Prograde***
- Rotational motion that is in the direction of the central body's orbit

***Retrograde***
- Rotation motion that is in the opposite direction of the central body's orbit

***Apoapsis***
- Highest point in an orbit where kinetic energy is lowest and potential energy is highest

***Periapsis***
- Lowest point in an orbit where kinetic energy is highest and potential energy is lowest

***Orbital Period***
- Time it takes for an object to complete a single orbit around a body

***[Semi-Major Axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_and_semi-minor_axes)***
- Longest radius of an orbit

***[Standard Gravitational Parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter)***
- Represented by Mu, it is the product of the gravitational constant G and the mass of the body

***[Escape Velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity)***
- Minimum speed needed to escape the gravitational influence of a body

***[Phase Angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_angle_(astronomy))***
- Angle between the current body, target body, and the central body (sun or planet)
	- This tells you how far forward or backward the target body will be relative to you

***[Delta V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v)***
- The amount of energy you have to perform a maneuver
	- Due to the lack of non-conservative forces (like air resistance) in the simulator, you maintain the same speed when performing maneuvers

***[Hohmann Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit)***
- This manuever is the most efficent way to perform an interplanetary transfer

***[Kerbal Space Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program)***
* A sandbox space flight simulator that features realistic orbital mechanics and physics
	* Values for the body's are taken directly from the [Kerbal Space Program Wiki](https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page)

### Design

Each planetary body is organized into a data structure that contains the important information about each planet. Each body
is identified with a number from zero to six, with zero being closest to the Sun and six being farthest. Additionally, the
length of the Semi-Major Axis and Escape Velocity for each body is also held.
